# Rex Orange County – THE SHADE

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I was closing all the blinds
just so you could sleep
the night through
I was staying by your side,
just so I knew you were okay
Then I was opening the door
just to see if you would
walk through
I started painting all the walls
just to see
if you liked the shade
I would love just to be,
stuck to your side
Not with anybody else,
anybody else
It's enough just to keep us
occupied
Please don't go
I would love just to be stuck
to your side
Not with anybody else,
anybody else no
It's enough just to keep us
occupied
Please don't go
You were holding out your hands
Hoping I'd be there to hold too
I went out to Amsterdam
Just so I could give you
some space
But I kept opening my door
just to see
if you would walk through
But now I'm painting
all my walls
just to see
if you like the shade
I would love just to be,
stuck to your side
Not with anybody else,
anybody else
It's enough just to keep us
occupied
Please don't go
I would love just to be stuck
to your side
Not with anybody else,
anybody else no
It's enough just to keep us
occupied
Please don't go
(Not with anybody else,
anybody else)
(Please don't go)
(Not with anybody else,
anybody else no)
(Please don't go)
