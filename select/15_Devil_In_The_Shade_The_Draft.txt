Don't look back till you realize
There's a lot still left to see.
I saw a picture of the devil in the shade
And there's a lot still left to see.

It's a restless night, I just want you to say you'll come with me.

Hey come with me, hey come with me.
Hey come with me, hey come with me.

'Cause I can't stand feeling paralyzed
And I can't wait for a break.
'Cause every time that I find myself alone
It's always there waiting for me.

It's a restless night, I just want you to say you'll come with me.

Hey come with me, hey come with me.
Hey come with me, hey come with me.
Hey come with me, hey come with me.
I needed a scare, so lock the doors and we'll get away.

Give me a place to go,
Somewhere I don't know.
Give me a place to go, 'cause anywhere is better.
Anyplace is, if you'll come with me.

Hey come with me, hey come with me.
Hey come with me, hey come with me.
Hey come with me, hey come with me.
I needed a scare, so lock the doors and we'll get away.
